Super simple FastAPI inference server for Dolphin (https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b-GGUF), running local OSX for me.

Note that calling generate() repeatedly APPENDS that new user message to the conversation. (Of course the server is ignorant)

client.reset() will truncate back to the system prompt

Sample usage:

"A neural network's web, an intricate maze,\nOf interconnected nodes in patterns grand,\nA structure that from nature's depth we raise,\nTo grasp and analyze this vast land.\n\nThe neurons therein do data's flow direct,\nEach node a tiny unit of thought or sense,\nAn organized array, a hidden secret sect,\nWhose wonders only those in knowledge commence.\n\nLike brain's own network, complex and deep,\nIt learns from patterns found within the stream,\nA system built on truths that we barely keep,\nThat grows with every passing day, it seems.\n\nSo let us praise this glorious neural strife,\nFor in its grasp, our world can come to life."

"Neural Networks, oh Neural Networks, a marvel that spins and weaves,\nA web of nodes and connections, like a network of leaves.\nThey learn, they grow, they adapt to the task at hand,\nTheir power lies within their intricate design, as grand.\n\nFrom input to output, a journey through the layers,\nIn a dance of patterns and computations that never slows or wavers.\nThrough the hidden world of weights and biases, they weave,\nThe secrets of the universe, in numbers, they believe.\n\nActivation functions, like gates, they open wide,\nUnleashing the power, Neural Networks glide.\nStochastic gradient descent, a dance in sync,\nA never-ending search for the optimal link.\n\nNeural Networks, the architects of our dreams,\nBuilding castles in the sky with their neuron streams.\nThe world is their oyster, as they conquer each task,\nNo challenge too great, no problem too vast.\n\nThrough supervised and unsupervised learning, they explore,\nAnd deep networks delve into the data's core.\nConvolutional Neural Networks, with filters in hand,\nFind patterns in images, a visual wonderland.\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks, a tale to unfold,\nA story of memory and time that never grows old.\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, the keepers of the past,\nEnsure our futures are shaped by the most relevant blast.\n\nNeural Networks, oh Neural Networks, a marvel indeed,\nTheir intelligence shines in every deed.\nThrough reinforcement learning and Q-learning too,\nThey conquer the world, with knowledge anew.\n\nTransformers, the new kids on the block,\nA self-attention mechanism that truly rock.\nLanguage models and image generation, they reign,\nAs Neural Networks evolve, our world is transformed again.\n\nNeural Networks, you're a force to be reckoned with,\nYour capabilities, expanding bit by bit.\nA future filled with AI and automation galore,\nWith Neural Networks at the core.\n\nNeural Networks, oh Neural Networks, your story never ceases,\nA tale of triumph and growth that only increases.\nSo let us celebrate, this magnificent feat,\nFor Neural Networks truly are a marvelous treat."
